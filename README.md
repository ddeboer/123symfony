123Symfony Symfony2 skeleton
============================

This is a skeleton for Symfony2 applications. It is based on the [Symfony2
Standard Edition](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard). All non-
essential stuff has been stripped. Some other things have been added:

* `app_test.php` for functional testing, e.g. with Behat

Requirements
------------

Ant is required to set up the application. Install it

* in Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt-get install ant`
* in Mac OS: included by default(?)

Usage
-----

Download:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ddeboer/symfony-skeleton

Set up:

    $ ant setup

Enjoy.
